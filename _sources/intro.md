# Welcome to MATH 4/5388 -- Machine Learning Methods

- Course Numbers: MATH 4388 and MATH 5388
- Course Name: Machine Learning Methods
- Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences
- University of Colorado Denver
- Instructor: Farhad Pourkamali, Ph.D.


This course focuses on learning from data and making predictions with minimal human intervention. You will explore fundamental concepts and techniques in machine learning and apply them to real-world problems through hands-on exercises. Using real-world datasets, you will build and evaluate models with tools such as Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas. 

Modern machine learning workflows integrate mathematics and code, and libraries like NumPy make it intuitive to translate mathematical operations (e.g., matrix and vector products) into clear, efficient code. By engaging with both theory and practical examples, you will strengthen your mathematical understanding while gaining the skills to implement models ranging from simple linear approaches to more advanced methods.

Throughout this course, you will learn about parametric regression and classification models, including linear and logistic regression, along with appropriate evaluation metrics. We will explore the concepts of bias and variance in machine learning methods and discuss the use of regularization techniques. The course will also cover advanced classical machine learning methods such as support vector machines, decision trees, and ensemble techniques like random forests. We will also introduce the fundamentals of unsupervised learning, focusing primarily on clustering methods. The course will conclude with an introduction to neural networks, including their underlying mathematics and basic implementation.
