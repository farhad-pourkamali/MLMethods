# Welcome to MATH 4/5388 -- Machine Learning Methods

- Course Numbers: MATH 4388 and MATH 5388
- Course Name: Machine Learning Methods
- Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences
- University of Colorado Denver
- Instructor: Farhad Pourkamali


This course focuses on learning from data and making predictions with minimal human intervention. You will explore fundamental concepts and techniques in machine learning and apply them to real-world problems through hands-on exercises. Using real-world datasets, you will build and evaluate models with tools such as Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas. 

Modern machine learning workflows integrate mathematics and code, and libraries like NumPy make it intuitive to translate mathematical operations (e.g., matrix and vector products) into clear, efficient code. By engaging with both theory and practical examples, you will strengthen your mathematical understanding while gaining the skills to implement models ranging from simple linear approaches to more advanced methods.
